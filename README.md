# Android App Survival Guide

This repo contains sample apps and slides for my talks and workshops about Android development.

## UnitTestDemo

This app demonstrates how a lot of current apps might look like (caution: not how they should ;-)).
For example, the version on master mixes core business logic and ui code. Also, there are no tests.
Branch unittestdemo_improved has, as the name suggests, some improvements. The aim of this branch is
not to be perfect but to provide a start.
